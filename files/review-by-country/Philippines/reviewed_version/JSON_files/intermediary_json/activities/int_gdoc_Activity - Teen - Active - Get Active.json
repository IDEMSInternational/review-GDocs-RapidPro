For example, walking, jogging, basketball or dancing.\n\u2022\tPick one together and try it out. \n\u2022\tIf you both like it, decide how often you are going to do it. Once or twice a week? Every morning?\n\u2022\tTogether think of ways to make it even more fun. Can you jog to a certain point? Take turns in being the coach? Motivate each other with a small free reward? "
