It needs to be the same length or slightly longer than the height of your child.\n\u2022\tAsk your child to lie down on the paper. Carefully draw the outline of your child.\n\u2022\tNow let your child fill in the outline: face, hair, clothes, shoes, or anything they want!\n\u2022\tAsk your child to draw things that they like and do not like outside of the outline.\n\u2022\tHave a conversation with your child about these things. You may learn something about your child!\n\u2022\tYou can put their outline up in their room or anywhere in the house \u2013 it will make your children feel appreciated!"
