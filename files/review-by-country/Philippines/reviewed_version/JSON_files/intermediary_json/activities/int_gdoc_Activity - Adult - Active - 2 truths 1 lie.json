For example, I hate bananas, I love ice cream and I really wish I could sing. \n\u2022\tSay them to your partner or friends. Ask them to guess which one is a lie. \n\u2022\tDid they guess correctly? Was it a surprise?\n\u2022\tNow ask them to do the same. Did you learn something new about each other? "
