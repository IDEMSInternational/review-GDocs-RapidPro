        "Message": "2 Truths, 1 Lie\n\u2022\tThink of three statements about yourself. Two must be true and one must be a lie.\n\u2022\tIt might help to think of wishes, dreams, experiences at school, likes or dislikes. For example, I hate bananas, my favourite subject is science, and I really wish I could sing. \n\u2022\tSay them to your teenager. Ask them to guess which one is a lie. \n\u2022\tDid they guess correctly? Was it a surprise?\n\u2022\tNow ask them to do the same. Did you learn something new about each other?"
