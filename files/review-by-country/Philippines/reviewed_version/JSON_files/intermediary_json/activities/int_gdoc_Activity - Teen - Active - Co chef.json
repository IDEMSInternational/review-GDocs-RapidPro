The first time, you may need to guide them. \n\u2022\tOnce your teen knows how to prepare the meal, let them take the lead and follow their instructions.\n\u2022\t Let each child and teen in the house have a turn at being the head chef.\n\u2022\tYou can even help them make a budget for ingredients!"
