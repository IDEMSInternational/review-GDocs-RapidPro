For example, a tree or a cup.\n\u2022\tSay to your child \u201cI see a tree, let\u2019s be it!\u201d\n\u2022\tCountdown from 5 and make the shape of a tree with your bodies. Be as big and silly as possible.\n\u2022\tNow let your child have a turn. What can they see?\n\u2022\tIf you can, go outside and be in nature. If you can\u2019t, play it inside. \n\u2022\tWhen you\u2019ve done it a few times, add moves and sounds!"
