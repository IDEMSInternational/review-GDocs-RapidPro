Content,Positive,CheckIn,Ignore,"I know, it can be really difficult to stay calm when our children are whining or having a tantrum. Try to think of something that you can do to help like taking a pause. You can do this!",,,,,,,,,,,PLH - Content - Positive - CheckIn - Ignore,0fdf90bf-9d5c-4be5-8dc8-21012d86b428,db43d7ef-21ff-414b-b1d0-b56a5b94d597

Content,Positive,CheckIn,Ignore,"Sometimes, our children can have very violent tantrums when they do not get their way, especially if they are used to it. Try to move your child to a place where they will not hurt themselves or others. You may need to firmly hold your child while ignoring their behaviour - but only do this if you can remain calm and  make sure you are not hurting them! Eventually, your child will calm down.",,,,,,,,,,,PLH - Content - Positive - CheckIn - Ignore,0fdf90bf-9d5c-4be5-8dc8-21012d86b428,639ebcf9-8b0e-4da4-b57a-16e675ffa620
