        "Option 1: Do it every day": {
          "Message": "1. Do it every day\nSet aside a specific time to spend One-on-One Time with your teen each day. Choose a time when you and our teen will not be interrupted and when your teen does not have something else that they want to do, like watching TV or playing with phones."
        },
        "Option 2: Let your teen choose the activity": {
          "Message 1": "2. Let your teen choose the activity\nTell your teen that you would like to spend some time with them and that they can choose what to do or talk about. Your teen might think this is weird at first but will come to enjoy having this dedicated time with you!",
          "Message 2": "Try to do something different than watching TV or playing with a tablet/phone. However, you may need to at first join your teen and watch their favourite TV programme with them. They may feel comfortable doing other activities with time."
        },
        "Option 3: Follow your teen's lead": {
          "Message": "3. Follow your teen's lead\nTry to follow your teen's lead during One-on-One Time. Accept their suggestions. Remember this is your teen's activity. Your job is to show an interest and say something nice."
        },
        "Option 4: Give your teen your full attention": {
          "Message 1": "4. Give your teen all of your attention. \nSwitch off the television and put away phones. Make sure you can give all of your attention to your teen.",
          "Message 2": "Look at your teen. Nodding or “I see” shows your teen you are really paying attention. Accept what they are saying without judging them."
        },
        "Option 5: Show your teen you are really listening": {
          "Message": "5. Show your teen you are really listening\n\nYou can even try rephrasing back what your teen says when they speak to you. For example, when your teen says, “This math problem is really hard,” you can say, “Yeah, I see that you are finding it difficult.” It shows you are really listening to them and will make them feel supported."
        },
        "Option 6: Have fun!": {
          "Message": "6. Have fun!\nOne-on-One Time with your teen can be fun for you, too! You might even find that you feel less stressed after spending time with your teen."
