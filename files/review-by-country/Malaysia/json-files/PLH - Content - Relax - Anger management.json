        "Message 2": "Think about what makes you angry? When does it happen? How do you normally react?\n\nPrevent anger from starting in the first place. Get some sleep or rest when you are tired. Try to eat something when you are hungry. Ask someone for support when you are feeling alone.",
        "Message 3": "Here are some things that can prevent bad things from happening when you are angry: \n\n1. Cut back on drinking alcohol or don’t drink, especially when the kids are awake.\n2. Do you have weapons or things that can be used to hurt others? Lock them up, hide them or take them out of the home.\n3. It’s ok to have your children stay somewhere safe or take them to a place where they can get help.",
        "Message 4": "Well done! You have added another skill to your Parenting Toolkit. Learning how to manage your anger can help you  avoid some difficult situations. "
