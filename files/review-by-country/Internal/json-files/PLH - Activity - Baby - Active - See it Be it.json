For example, a tree or a cup.\n•\tSay to your child “I see a tree, let’s be it”.\n•\tCountdown from 5 and make the shape of a tree with your bodies. Be as big and silly as possible.\n•\tNow let your child have a turn. What can they see?\n•\tIf you can, go outside and be in nature. If you can’t, play it inside. \n•\tWhen you’ve done it a few times, add moves and sounds!"
