It helps build creativity.\n•\tGet some pens or crayons and a piece of paper or cardboard.\n•\tLet your children freely draw whatever they want.\n•\tWhile your child is drawing, use words to describe what they are doing: “I see you are drawing a person” or “I see you are making lines with the red crayon.”\n•\tYou can also have fun drawing next to them.\n•\tPut their drawings up on the wall, refrigerator, or outside to decorate the house – it will make your children feel appreciated!"
