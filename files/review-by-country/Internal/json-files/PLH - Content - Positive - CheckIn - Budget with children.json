        "Positive follow on question": "Well done for taking the time to do this! How did it go? (Great/Neutral/Bad)",
        "Great response message": "We are happy to hear that it went well! Budget planning as a family can help you have enough money to get through the month and also reduce arguments!"

          "Message": "That is okay! What did you find challenging about discussing budgeting with your family?",
          "Option 1: I did not want to tell my family how much I earn": {
            "Message": "It is completely normal to experience this. You don’t have to reveal the exact amount you earn; you could give an estimate. You could say, “In this household, we have this amount of money every month” rather than, “I make this amount of money”."
          },
          "Option 2: When budgeting, we could not agree on what should fall under needs and what should fall under wants": {
            "Message": "It is completely normal to experience this challenge. People’s wants and needs are different sometimes. Talking about them together can help you and your child or teen to understand each other, respect your differences, and see where you can compromise."
          },
          "Option 3: I did not understand what to do": {
            "Message": "We are sorry to hear this. We know it can be difficult! Why don’t we go through the content again? Your teen or other family members can join and help you! "
          },
          "Option 4: My child or teen did not want to do the budgeting with me": {
            "Message": "It is completely normal to experience this challenge. Try making the budget with other adults in your home first. Your child or teen may get interested in what you are doing. Making a budget may sound serious but try to make it fun – make it a game during one-on-one time! Remember to praise them when you are done!"
          },
          "Option 5: I did not have the time to talk about family budgeting with my child or teen": {
            "Message": "It can be hard to find time during your day, with work, chores, and everything else. Can you think of even 30 minutes this week to do this activity? You can even break each step up into shorter activities and spread it across the week. You can do it!"
