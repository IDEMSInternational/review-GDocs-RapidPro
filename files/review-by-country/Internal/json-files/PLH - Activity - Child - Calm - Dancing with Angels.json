It also builds trust between you and your child.\n•\tPlay a piece of music that is gentle and relaxed to encourage smooth and calming movement.\n•\tOne person goes first and closes their eyes while the other person is the guardian angel or protector.\n•\tThe guardian angel must protect the person with their eyes closed from harm while gently dancing together.\n•\tWhen the music ends, the dancer can open their eyes before switching roles."
