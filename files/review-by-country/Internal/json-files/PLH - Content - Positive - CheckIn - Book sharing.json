            "Message": "It is completely normal to experience this challenge, and it can be difficult to know what to do at first. Next time try sitting with your child and a book. Let your child take the lead and follow their interest. You don't even need to read...just looking at the pictures together and talking about them works!"

            "Message": "It is completely normal to experience this challenge, it can be difficult to get your child's attention. Next time try letting your child choose the book. It can even be a magazine or colouring the book. You don't even need to read...just looking at the pictures together and talking about them works!"

            "Message": "It is completely normal to experience this challenge, it can be really difficult to find the time our busy lives. Can you think of a time during the day when you may be less busy, such as early in the morning or after dinner?  It will make a big difference in improving your relationship AND their learning abilities!"
