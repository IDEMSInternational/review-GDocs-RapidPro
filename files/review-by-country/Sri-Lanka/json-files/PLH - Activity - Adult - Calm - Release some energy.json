It’s the ability to transform from a grumpy, angry person into a calm, clear one. \n•\tWhen I’m feeling frustrated I plant my feet firmly on the ground and I breathe in and out three times as slowly as I can. Sometimes I imagine I’m smelling a flower and blowing out a candle. \n•\tDa ta! Pause Power! My transformation from grumpy to calm is complete!"
