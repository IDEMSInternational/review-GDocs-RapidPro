          "Message": "1. Do it every day!\nTry to spend time playing with your baby every day for at least 20 minutes where you are giving them your full attention. Choose a time when you are unlikely to be interrupted. Switch off the television and put away phones."

          "Message 2": "It is okay for your child to want to do many different things. Your child’s attention may wander to many different things during One-on-One Time.
