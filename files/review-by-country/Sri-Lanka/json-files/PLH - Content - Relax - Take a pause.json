Notice if your emotions are pleasant or unpleasant. Whatever you are feeling, it is okay. Notice how your body feels. Notice anything that hurts or is tense. \nFocus on your breath as it goes in and out. Do this for about 10 breaths. \nNow, expand your awareness to your whole body. Listen to the sounds in the room. \nTake a moment to reflect on whether you feel any different. ",
